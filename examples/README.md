# Examples

Example applications will live in the subdirectories of this folder. Before running any of them, make sure the Cesium runtime assets are present in each example's `public/Cesium` directory:

```bash
./scripts/sync_cesium_assets.sh
```

The script expects a vendor copy of Cesium under `vendor/Cesium/<version>/Build/Cesium`. If you have already downloaded `Cesium-1.135`, it will vendorize it automatically the first time you run the command.
